<h2>Yuyang Sang 桑榆扬 <a href="doc/CV.pdf">CV</a></h2>
<p>
I am a researcher at Alibaba Cloud US LLC, where I focus on employing formal verification techniques to ensure the correctness and reliability of components within Alibaba Cloud's infrastructure.
I received my Ph.D. from Yale <a href="https://flint.cs.yale.edu/">FLINT</a> group, working under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/shao-zhong/">Zhong Shao</a>.
During my doctoral studies, I recognized that specifying and verifying software is just as important as implementing it. This insight drives my commitment to integrating formal methods into the software development lifecycle and advocating for their adoption as an industry standard.
My research initially focused on developing programming languages that facilitate reasoning about system specifications, implementations, and their refinements.
Since joining Alibaba, I have shifted my focus toward enhancing the scalability and automation of formal verification tools and techniques.
</p>
<p>
In addition to formal verification, I am passionate about applying programming language techniques to cryptography, aiming to enhance both its efficiency and accessibility.
My ultimate goal is to simplify the implementation of cryptographic protocols, making them as intuitive as writing standard programs while ensuring optimal performance.
