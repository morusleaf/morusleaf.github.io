<h2>Yuyang Sang 桑榆扬 <a href="doc/CV.pdf">CV</a></h2>
<p>
I am a Ph.D. student in Yale <a href="https://flint.cs.yale.edu/">FLINT</a> group supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/shao-zhong/">Zhong Shao</a>.
I am interested in doing research on programming language and formal methods.
In my view, the process of specifying and verifying software is just as critical as implementing it. Thus, I believe that incorporating these practices into the development cycle and making them an industrial standard is essential for the future.
I am of the opinion that creating correct software should be just as simple as implementing it. Programmers typically possess informal specifications and proofs in their minds or in their documentation. As such, I focus on developing frameworks and tools that assist them in formally writing down specifications and obtaining machine-verifiable proof of software correctness.

In addition to my primary research focus, I've recently become intrigued by the potential for applying programming language techniques to cryptography to enhance its efficiency and user-friendliness.
My ultimate goal is to simplify the implementation of cryptographic protocols, making them as straightforward as writing typical programs while ensuring optimal performance.
